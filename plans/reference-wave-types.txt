Wave Types Reference (from surfdeeper.com/concept/types-of-waves)
================================================================

FOUR PRIMARY WAVE CLASSIFICATIONS:

1. ROLLING (SPILLING) WAVES
   - Gentle waves that slowly spill forward as the crest collapses
   - Smooth, foamy characteristics
   - White water tumbles down the face
   - Ideal for beginners

2. PLUNGING WAVES
   - Sharp curling that creates a hollow tube/barrel
   - Intense, fast-moving, highly dynamic
   - The lip throws out over the face
   - What advanced surfers pursue
   - THIS IS WHAT WE WANT FOR THE GAME

3. COLLAPSING WAVES
   - Lose structure suddenly
   - Collapse without significant forward momentum
   - Chaotic splashing rather than graceful curling

4. SURGING WAVES
   - Don't break traditionally
   - Surge up the shore with strong momentum
   - Appear as a wall of water pushing onto beach
   - Rapid, shallow characteristics

================================================================
KEY INSIGHT: "Spirals are nature's way of channeling energy efficiently"
- Wave patterns reflect broader natural systems
- Energy flows in spiral/vortex patterns

================================================================
WAVE ANATOMY (general surfing knowledge, not from page):

- FACE: The unbroken, steep front of the wave (rideable surface)
- LIP: The curling top edge that throws over
- POCKET: Sweet spot just ahead of the curl, steepest part, most power
- SHOULDER: The unbroken section tapering away from the peak
- BARREL/TUBE: Hollow space when lip throws over face
- WHITEWATER/FOAM: Broken, turbulent water after wave breaks
- PEAK: Where the wave first starts breaking
- TROUGH: Bottom/base of the wave

PEEL DIRECTION:
- "Left" = breaks to surfer's left (facing shore)
- "Right" = breaks to surfer's right
- Wave PEELS along the line as the break travels laterally
