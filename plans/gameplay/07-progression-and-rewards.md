# Progression & Rewards

Purpose: goals and incentives decoupled from core physics.

## Unlockables
- Boards: affect speed, stability, maneuverability.
- Cosmetics: wetsuits, decals, session badges.

## Challenges
- Trick chains: aerials, carves, timed sequences.
- Ride quality: length, speed, diversity of maneuvers.

## Systems
- XP + tiered rewards; optional randomized loot boxes.
- Events: daily challenges, seasonal swells, rare drops.

## Integration
- Listens to player event bus (tricks, ride end, wipeout).
- Saves progression to local storage; future: cloud sync.
- Debug panel: grant/unlock tools for testing.

## Testing
- Unit tests for scoring and reward logic.
- E2E tests for unlock flows and persistence.
