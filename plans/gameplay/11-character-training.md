## Training Interface

### Weekly Schedule
- Plan workouts for each day
- Balance training with rest (overtraining = injury risk)
- Morning/afternoon/evening slots

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Monday  │ Tuesday │Wednesday│Thursday │
├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ Swim AM │ Surf    │ Gym PM  │ Rest    │
│ Yoga PM │         │         │ Yoga PM │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

### Session Types
- **Light**: minimal gains, no fatigue
- **Moderate**: balanced gains and fatigue
- **Intense**: high gains, high fatigue, injury risk

### Fatigue System
- Training adds fatigue
- Surfing adds fatigue
- Rest days reduce fatigue
- High fatigue = reduced performance, injury risk
- Sleep quality matters (late nights hurt recovery)

## Character Customization

### Appearance
- Body type (affects base stats)
- Hair style / color
- Skin tone
- Facial features
- Tattoos, scars (earned or cosmetic)

### Body Development
- Training visibly changes physique over time
- Swim a lot → broader shoulders
- Skip leg day → visible imbalance (meme mode)
- Bulk vs lean training paths

### Age & Career
- Start young (high potential, low stats)
- Or start older (lower ceiling, more starting skill)
- Stats naturally decline with age (long-term play)
- Injuries accumulate over career

---

## Lifestyle Factors

### Diet
- Healthy eating → better recovery, sustained energy
- Junk food → quick energy, poor recovery
- Hydration matters before sessions

### Sleep
- 8 hours → full recovery
- 6 hours → partial recovery
- 4 hours → fatigue builds, reaction time suffers
- Party the night before → rough session

### Mental State
- Meditation / visualization → better focus, style bonus
- Stress → reduced performance
- Confidence builds with success, drops with wipeouts

---

## Progression Curves

### Beginner Phase (0-100 hours)
- Rapid gains from any training
- Focus on fundamentals
- Injury risk from overtraining

### Intermediate Phase (100-500 hours)
- Gains slow down
- Specialization matters more
- Need targeted training for specific stats

### Advanced Phase (500+ hours)
- Marginal gains require focused effort
- Maintenance becomes important
- Peak performance windows

---

## Injuries & Recovery

### Training Injuries
- Overtraining → muscle strain
- Bad form → joint issues
- Accidents → acute injuries

### Recovery Options
- Rest (free, slow)
- Physical therapy (cost, faster)
- Sports massage (cost, moderate)
- Ice bath → reduces inflammation

### Long-term Health
- Chronic issues from repeated injuries
- Shoulder problems (paddling)
- Back issues (pop-ups, wipeouts)
- Knee problems (turns, compression)

---

## Coaches & Mentors

### Surf Coach
- Analyzes your sessions
- Suggests technique improvements
- Helps with wave reading
- Cost per session or monthly

### Personal Trainer
- Designs workout programs
- Tracks your progress
- Adjusts for your goals
- Gym membership + trainer fee

### Yoga Instructor

---

## Integration

- Stats affect gameplay physics (paddle speed, balance threshold)
- Training costs time (opportunity cost vs surfing)
- Ties to shop (gym memberships, equipment, supplements)
- Shaper consults your stats for board recommendations
- Injury system ties to health/hospital (plan 09)

---

## Testing

- Balance: training shouldn't make surfing trivial
- Progression feels rewarding but not grindy
- Injuries are consequential but not frustrating
- Different build paths are viable (swimmer vs gym rat vs yogi)
