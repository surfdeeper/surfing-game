# AI Plans

Design notes, ideas, and feedback for the AI surfer system.

Use this folder for:
- Surfing AI heuristics, behaviors, and control loops
- Feedback from playtesting the AI surfer
- Iterations on lineup logic, wave selection, and riding strategy

Number new plans with the existing convention (increments of 10) and keep problem/solution/steps sections.
