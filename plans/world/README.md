# World & Environment Plans

This directory contains plans for environmental immersion and emergent behaviors beyond core wave simulation and player mechanics.

## Sections
- Animals: ambient life, subtle interactions, optional AI behaviors
- Hazards: rare threats that add tension without dominating gameplay
- Dynamic Ocean: currents, winds, tides that influence strategy and feel
- Tsunami: dramatic rare event with massive wave for high-stakes moments
- Real-World Conditions: live surf/weather data from Open-Meteo for famous breaks
- Rip Currents: localized seaward flows for strategic depth and hazard awareness
