# 1. Bathymetry (Ocean Floor)

The ocean floor depth profile determines how waves behave. Shallower water
causes waves to slow down, steepen, and eventually break.

## Depth Profiles

These profiles show different ways the ocean floor can slope from deep water
(dark blue, top) to shore (tan, bottom).

**Linear Slope**: Constant gradient - simple, predictable wave behavior.

**Steep Shore**: Deep water plateau with rapid shallowing near beach. Waves
maintain speed longer, then break suddenly.

**Flat Bottom**: No gradient - useful as a reference or for deep water scenarios
where waves don't interact with the bottom.

## Bottom Features

Natural features create localized depth changes that affect wave behavior:

**Sandbar**: A shallow ridge in mid-water creates a secondary breaking zone.
Waves may break on the bar, reform, then break again at shore.

**Reef**: Localized shallow spot (coral reef, rock formation). Creates a
focused breaking zone - popular surf spots often feature reefs.

**Channel**: A deeper groove between shallow areas (common at river mouths).
Waves don't break in channels, creating a path for paddling out.

## Wave Speed Formula

Wave speed in shallow water follows:

```
c = sqrt(g * d)
```

Where:
- `c` = wave celerity (speed)
- `g` = gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s)
- `d` = water depth

As depth decreases, wave speed decreases proportionally with the square root.
This causes waves to:
1. Slow down as they approach shore
1. Stack up (wavelength shortens)
1. Increase in height (energy conservation)
1. Eventually break when H/d > 0.78
